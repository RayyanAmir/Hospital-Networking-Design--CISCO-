Hospital Management Networking Project
Project Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive network topology for a hospital management system using Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal is to design and implement a robust and secure network infrastructure that meets the needs of a modern hospital.

Technologies Implemented
Network Topology Design: Creating a network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer.
Hierarchical Network Design: Implementing a structured and scalable network design.
Networking Devices: Connecting devices with the correct cabling.
Device Configuration: Configuring basic settings on networking devices.
VLANs: Creating VLANs and assigning ports with VLAN numbers for network segmentation.
Subnetting and IP Addressing: Implementing subnetting for efficient IP address management.
Inter-VLAN Routing: Configuring inter-VLAN routing on multilayer switches using Switch Virtual Interface (SVI).
DHCP Server: Setting up a dedicated DHCP server for dynamic IP allocation.
SSH: Configuring SSH for secure remote access to network devices.
Routing Protocol: Configuring OSPF as the routing protocol for dynamic routing.
NAT Overload (PAT): Implementing NAT overload for efficient IP address usage.
Site-to-Site VPN: Configuring IPsec VPN for secure site-to-site communication.
Access Control Lists (ACL): Setting up standard and extended ACLs for traffic filtering.
Switchport Security: Configuring switchport security on switches to prevent unauthorized access.
WLAN: Setting up a wireless network using Cisco Access Points.
Host Device Configurations: Configuring end devices within the network.
